## Product Hunt Title
Ping-Me - Keep your free-tier backends alive with auto-pinging & metrics

## Product Hunt Tagline
The easiest way to prevent your free-tier backend services from going to sleep

## Product Hunt Description
**The Problem**
Free-tier hosting platforms like Render, Railway, Vercel, and Heroku put your backend to sleep after minutes of inactivity. This means your users face cold starts - slow loading times that make your app feel broken.

**The Solution**
Ping-Me automatically keeps your backends awake with scheduled pinging. It's a lightweight open-source solution that:

âœ… Prevents backend sleep cycles
âœ… Tracks response times and downtime
âœ… Sends alerts when your services go down
âœ… Works with any Node.js framework
âœ… Includes a beautiful metrics dashboard

**Who is this for?**
- Developers with side projects
- Startups using free hosting tiers
- Anyone who wants to avoid the "cold start" problem

We've made it ridiculously easy to integrate - just one line of code in your Node.js app:

```javascript
require('ping-me')({ apiKey: 'your-key' });
```

## Maker Comment
Hey Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

I built Ping-Me because I was tired of my side projects on free hosting tiers going to sleep and making users wait. 

Instead of paying for premium hosting just to keep services awake, I created this lightweight solution that anyone can use to keep their backends responsive.

It's completely open source and free to use for up to 3 endpoints. We also offer affordable plans for those who need more.

I'd love to hear your feedback and answer any questions!
